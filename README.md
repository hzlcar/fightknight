Fight Knight is a web game I created for my Web Engineering course at Chapman University.
For this project I utilized HTML for the website layout and CSS for the page style
I used JavaScript to program all the combat mechanics and conditions


Fight Knight is a turn-based fighting game that simulates sword combat
For your turn you may attack, parry, or block, each with their own advantages and disadvantages depening on the opponent's moves
You can also utilize FP to give you temporary boosts or permanenty upgrade your stats
Whenever you defeat a knight, a new more powerful knight approaches. See how many you can fight before perishing!
